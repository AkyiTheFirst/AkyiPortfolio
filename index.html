        <!--About Me-->
        <section class = "aboutMe">
            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>I am a self-taught digital artist, who does a little bit of graphic design and some traditional art.
                My main strong suit will be pixelart which I enjoy the most while doing scenery backgrounds and pixel icons.
                On top of doing digital art, I am also a computer science student with strong basic coding knowledge. I have already learned languages such as C, Java, Python and JavaScript.
                I have also worked as a coding coach at <a href = "https://www.ciyclub.com.mm/">CIY.CLUB Myanmar</a> where I teach block-coding and basic electronics to younger generation.
                During my time as a coach, I have also been trained to be proficient in 3D design using <a href = "https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad Website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, I can also create front-end web-pages using html, css and a little bit of javaScript<br>
                As for contact, dial my hotline <a href = "tel: +959774325411">+95977*****11</a> or send a mail to <a href = "mailto: kyiphyu.professional@gmail.com">kyiphyu.professional@gmail.com</a>
                However, I don't currently provide physical art pieces or prints due to certain circumstances. Down below are some of my projects.

                    <p class = "projectInfo"><em class = "imgTitle">Mandalay Kyone : </em>Mandalay is where I feel my true freedom. I illustrated this when I was away from the place I love most.</p>

                    <p class = "projectInfo"><em class = "imgTitle">Fantasia Mushrooms : </em>I've watched Disney's fantasia as a kid and was obsessed with this scene. These mushrooms danced to the "Chinese Dance" from "Tchaicovsky's Nutcracker Suite".</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "projectCard">

                    <p class = "projectInfo"><em class = "imgTitle">Pixel Stars : </em>I love both pixelart and stars. So this pixelart became my favourite for a while. My favourite part about pixelart is learning how to use colors to achieve blended effect.</p>

                    <p class = "projectInfo"><em class = "imgTitle">Seashore : </em>Apart from stars, I love being in water. I love swimming especially in the sea. For me, water indicates freedom. Letting things flow as they pass by, not being attached to anything.</p>

                    <p class = "projectInfo"><em class = "imgTitle">Excalibur : </em>As I am a huge fun of classic Disney, "The Sword in the Stone" became another inspiration for me to illustrate this piece. I wanted it to be whimsical and dreamy and I am satisfied with the results.</p>

                    <p class = "projectInfo"><em class = "imgTitle">The Moon : </em>For someone who admires the moon, I gifted this pixelart as a loving gift. I feel peaceful when I look at this piece, just like how he makes me feel.</p>
